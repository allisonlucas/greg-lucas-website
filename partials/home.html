                    <p class="light left-align">The Global Electric Circuit involves the investigation of global variations in atmospheric currents and electric fields created by the distribution of thunderstorms. These electrical pathways can be measured to obtain an understanding of different atmospheric parameters. Greg has created a new Global Electric Circuit model for use within large scale climate models.</p>

                    <p class="light left-align">Upon completion of his Masters Degree, Greg worked at Sandia National Laboratories on a space nuclear risk analysis team. His responsibilities involved numeric modeling of accident scenarios and probabilities to assess the risk of launching nuclear material into space. Greg's primary mission was risk assessment of the Mars Science Laboratory, which carried a radioisotope power system onboard.</p>
