  <p class="light left-align">The previous calculations of conductivity and sources were used to generate fair-weather currents and electric fields. The use of a community climate model for WACCM-GEC allows the surface electric fields to vary over time. The evolution of the surface electric fields at two antarctic stations (Vostok and Concordia) are compared for observational data (solid lines) and for the WACCM-GEC model output (dashed lines).</p>

  <p class="light left-align">The figure above shows that the model produces a diurnal signature of electric fields in universal time and that there is a distinct phasing difference between these sites due to the imposed high-latitude magnetospheric potential pattern. There are still differences between the observations and modeling such as the amplitude of the deviations due to the source strengths, which is a current area of investigation and research. WACCM-GEC has been developed to allow researchers to investigate possible coupling mechanisms between atmospheric processes and the global electric circuit in a physics-based model that is open to the community.</p>
