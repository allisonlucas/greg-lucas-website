  <p class="light left-align">The Global Electric Circuit (GEC) is a research field that investigates the electrical connections within Earth's atmosphere. Responses of this system can be strongly time dependent, and generalized as an AC (alternating current) response, or slowly time-varying and DC (direct current). AC responses include lightning and transient luminous events, and the different electromagnetic signals sent out from these, such as VLF, ELF. My research focuses on the DC aspect of the GEC, which views the atmosphere as a leaky capacitor with the ground and ionosphere being the two plates of the conductor. More information on the project I am involved with can be found on the <span><a href="http://sisko.colorado.edu/FESD/" class="red-text text-darken-4">project website</a></span>.</p>

  <p class="light left-align">Currently I am developing numerical models for modeling phenomena within the GEC. To model the effect of clouds on the electrical responses of the system I utilized a finite element package to simulate different cloud parameters. This work can be viewed in the recent <span><a href="http://www.atmos-chem-phys-discuss.net/14/9815/2014/acpd-14-9815-2014.pdf" class="red-text text-darken-4">Journal of Atmosphere and Chemistry paper I co-authored</a></span>. I also presented <span><a href="http://ccar.colorado.edu/glucas/docs/TEA-IS_summer_school_Lucas.pdf" class="red-text text-darken-4">results from a full 3D model</a></span> at the <span><a href="http://tea-is-2014.cnrs-orleans.fr/" class="red-text text-darken-4">TEA-IS summer school</a></span> in France.</p>

  <p class="light left-align">To investigate the coupling aspect of different phenomena within the GEC I have incorporated the work on conductivity and source currents into a global circulation model (WACCM). This leverages large climate models that solve the complex atmospheric forcing terms and allow for the GEC currents and electric fields to be solved in a realistic manner. A description of this new modeling framework called WACCM-GEC can be viewed <span><a href="http://ccar.colorado.edu/glucas/GEC.html" class="red-text text-darken-4">here</a></span>.</p>
