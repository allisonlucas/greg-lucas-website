  <p class="light left-align">Within the ionosphere and magnetosphere there are currents that are flowing that are external to the GEC. However, these currents are able to produce large scale potential patterns that can be impressed upon the GEC. These potential patterns are largest at high-latitudes near the geomagnetic poles. The potential difference above each column of atmosphere is modified by these magnetospheric potential perturbations in a self-consistent way to ensure there is no leakage current between the two separate current systems. After the PD of each column has been determined, the current density and electric field at every point in the atmosphere is calculated as shown above.</p>
