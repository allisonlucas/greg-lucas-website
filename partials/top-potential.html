  <p class="light left-align">To get the global signature for the GEC, the total current flowing in the domain and the total resistance are used to set the highly conductive ionosphere to a different potential from the surface of the earth. This results in a potential difference (PD) that varies depending on the conductivity and source distributions within the domain.</p>
