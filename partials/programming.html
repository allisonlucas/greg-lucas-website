  <p class="light left-align">One of Greg's passions ever since he was young has been working with computers. He began programming in Perl and has since expanded into many other languages including C, C++, Java, Fortran, and his current workhorse, Python. Greg utilizes many of these languages to assist him in his research, as well as in his hobbies. All of his projects and code are available upon request, and some of them are located in his <span><a href="https://github.com/greglucas" class="red-text text-darken-4">github repository</a></span>.</p>
  <h5 class="header col s12 brown-text text-darken-2">Kennedy Space Center Data Analysis</h5>
  <img id="programming-img-1" class="materialboxed" src="./images/landbreeze.png">
  <p class="light left-align">For an analysis of electric field data, Greg has created several parsers for publicly available data. The Kennedy Space Center data was (and still is) formatted in a ridiculous binary format that was poorly documented (half the file size is empty zeros - what a waste!), which is probably one of the major reasons no one has published on this data. Greg decided to write his own parser and make it publicly available for others to utilize the datasets as they would like. That can be found <span><a href="https://github.com/greglucas/KSC" class="red-text text-darken-4">here.</a></span><br>Some of the data analysis Greg is focusing on is the influence of local scale meteorology on various electric field mills. To visualize the results, Greg has separated out inland versus near-ocean sites and plotted the electric field over time. March 6th 2000 was identified in a meteorology paper as being a day with a land breeze occurring at the cape. The following is a simple plot of the field mill that clearly shows the land breeze passing through the field mills at 6 UTC, correlating extremely well with the report. Greg is also conducting further analysis with winds and electric fields that will hopefully be published soon. Please contact him if you are interested in any of this data or work.</p>
